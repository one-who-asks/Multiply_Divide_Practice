This is a macro enabled excel file. Since it is coming from another computer (mine), it will likely be blocked, and the macro won't work after downloading.

Before unblocking the file, I urge you to review the VBA code for yourself so you know what you are running. To do this go to the "Developer" tab and then
choose "Visual Basic". This will bring up the Visual Basic (VBA) code. This code should match what is in the VBA_code file of this github project.

Once you've confirmed that this Macro is not malicious, you can use the url below which will bring up instructions on how to unblock the file.
